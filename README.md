explore the dataset and generate insights from it.   Here is the description of all the variables / features available in the dataset which will help you to perform EDA:  id - a unique identifier for each trip vendor_id - a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record pickup_datetime - date and time when the meter was engaged dropoff_datetime - date and time when the meter was disengaged passenger_count - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value) pickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged pickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged dropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged dropoff_latitude - the latitude where the meter was disengaged store_and_fwd_flag - This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server (Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip) trip_duration - (target) duration of the trip in seconds You can download the dataset from the link given below and perform the EDA on this dataset. Once you have finished the EDA, submit the jupyter notebook and we will evaluate it.
